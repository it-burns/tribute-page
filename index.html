                </p>
                <p>David Eric Grohl was born in Warren, Ohio, the son of Virginia Jean (n√©e Hanlon), a teacher, and James
                    Harper Grohl (1938-2015), at the time a newswriter.[9] He has Slovak, German, and Irish
                    ancestry.[10][11] When he was a child, Grohl's family moved from Warren, to Springfield, Virginia. When
                    Grohl was seven, his parents divorced,[12] and he subsequently grew up with his mother.</p>
                <p>At the age of twelve, Grohl began learning to play guitar. He grew tired of lessons and instead taught
                    himself, and he eventually began playing in bands with friends.[5][13] A year later, Grohl and his
                    sister spent the summer in Evanston, Illinois, at their cousin Tracy's house. Tracy introduced them to
                    punk rock by taking the pair to shows by a variety of punk bands. His first concert was Naked Raygun at
                    The Cubby Bear in Chicago in 1982 when he was 13 years old.[14] "From then on we were totally punk",
                    Grohl recalled. "We went home and bought Maximumrocknroll and tried to figure it all out".[13]</p>
                <p>In Virginia, Grohl attended Thomas Jefferson High School as a freshman. He was elected vice president of
                    his freshman class and in that capacity would manage to play bits of songs by punk bands like Circle
                    Jerks and Bad Brains over the school intercom before his morning announcements. Grohl's mother decided
                    that he should transfer to Bishop Ireton High School in Alexandria because his cannabis use was
                    affecting his grades. He stayed there two years, beginning with a repeat of first year. After his second
                    year, he transferred yet again, to Annandale High School.[13]</p>
                <p>While in high school, Grohl played in several local bands, including a stint as guitarist in a band
                    called Freak Baby. It was during this period that Grohl taught himself to play drums.[5] When Freak Baby
                    kicked out its bass player, Grohl decided to switch to drums, and the reconstituted band renamed
                    themselves Mission Impossible.[13] During his developing years as a drummer, Grohl cited John Bonham as
                    his greatest influence, and eventually had Bonham's three-rings symbol tattooed on his wrist.[15]
                    Mission Impossible later rebranded themselves Fast before breaking up, after which Grohl joined the
                    post-punk-influenced hardcore punk band Dain Bramage.[16][17]</p>
                <p>Many of Grohl's early influences were gained at the 9:30 club, a live music venue in Washington D.C.: "I
                    went to the 9:30 club hundreds of times. I was always so excited to get there, and I was always bummed
                    when it closed. I spent my teenage years at the club and saw some shows that changed my life".[18]</p>
                <p>Grohl said in an interview with The Guardian, "They don't understand that when I was 15 and had Zen
                    Arcade, that's when I decided that I loved this music. For me to do anything else for the sole reason of
                    doing something different would be so contrived".[19]</p>
